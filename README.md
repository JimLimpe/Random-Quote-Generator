For this project I used React and Bootstrap. It is a simple quote generator tha allows the user to update quotes on screen and also offers the possibility to tweet to X his favorite quote.
It is the 1 out of 5 projects needed, for freeCodeCamp in order to grab my Fronted End Libraries Certification. 
Its a great way to get more familiar with React and Github pushing and deploying.
